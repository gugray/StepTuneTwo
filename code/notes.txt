-- Nema16 Motor WEIRD with this controller.
  -> Trying Nema17 with higher amp rating.
  -> Need different controller? Hope not.

-- Max timer freq that seems to work is 80kHz.
   Higher works from main loop, but ISR overhead
   This is already with freq back up at 20MHz

Design changes:
-- Drive the controllers' enable pin too (so they can rest)
-- Clock signal didn't work; just stick with edge interrupt handler
-- Redesign around 48MHz CH32V003 in SOP16
-- Use 5V for MCU for higher CPU freq
-- Higher external OSC freq; with divider (can do on same 4096?)
